    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. These algorithms operate by building a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being specifically programmed to perform the task. Examples include recommendation engines, spam filters, and fraud detection systems.",

    # 15. Cleaned sentence from marketing or blog block
