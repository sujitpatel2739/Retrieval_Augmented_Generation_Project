# RAG Workflows

Workflows orchestrate the execution of RAG components in a specific sequence. Each workflow manages component execution, error handling, logging, and result aggregation.

## Core Concepts

### Base Workflow
The `BaseWorkflow` class provides fundamental workflow capabilities:
- Unique workflow ID generation
- Automatic logging of all steps
- Error handling and recovery
- Metadata management
- Execution time tracking

### Standard RAG Workflow
The default `RAGWorkflow` implements a 5-step RAG process:
1. Query intent routing
2. Query reformulation
3. Context retrieval
4. Completion checking
5. Answer generation

Each step's results and metadata are automatically logged, allowing for detailed analysis of the workflow's performance.

## Workflow Patterns

### Branching Workflows
Workflows can implement conditional logic to take different paths based on:
- Query intent
- Confidence scores
- Retrieved context quality
- Business rules

### Iterative Workflows
Some use cases require multiple passes through components:
- Recursive retrieval for complex queries
- Progressive query refinement
- Multi-step reasoning chains

### Parallel Workflows
Components can be executed in parallel when:
- Steps are independent
- Multiple retrieval strategies are used
- Different models are being compared

## Error Handling

Workflows provide robust error handling:
- Failed steps are logged with error details
- Partial results are preserved
- Custom recovery strategies can be implemented
- Error metadata is captured for analysis

## Monitoring & Analysis

Every workflow execution captures:
- Component-level metrics
- Execution times
- Success/failure rates
- Custom metadata
- Input/output for each step

This data can be analyzed through the logging visualization dashboard or exported for custom analysis.

## Best Practices

1. **Metadata Management**
   - Track version information
   - Log environment details
   - Include business context
   - Capture model parameters

2. **Error Handling**
   - Define clear failure modes
   - Implement appropriate fallbacks
   - Preserve partial results
   - Log detailed error context

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor component execution times
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Consider parallel execution

4. **Testing**
   - Unit test individual components
   - Integration test full workflows
   - Benchmark performance
   - Validate error handling
